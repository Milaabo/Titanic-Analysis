## Introduction

The titanic dataset typically includes the following columns:

- PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.

- Survived: This column indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

- Pclass (Ticket class): A proxy for socio-economic status, with 1 being the highest class and 3 the lowest.

- Name: The name of the passenger.

- Sex: The gender of the passenger.

- Age: The age of the passenger. (Note: There might be missing values in this column.)

- SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.

- Parch: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.

- Ticket: The ticket number.

- Fare: The amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket.

This dashboard was created to understand the key events that happened before and after the titanic accident.
